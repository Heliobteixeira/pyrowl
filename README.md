[NotifyMyAndroid][nma]
---------------
NotifyMyAndroid is a platform that allows you to delivery push notifications from virtually any application to your Android device. We offer a client application that runs on your Android device and a set of easy to use public APIs that can be integrated into your software. (source: http://www.notifymyandroid.com/)

### How it works:
First, import the module:

    import pynma

#### Keys management

Create a PyNMA simple instance:

    p = pynma.PyNMA( "apikey(s)", "developerkey")

A developerkey is optional. If you'd like to add just one API key, set it as string, if you want more, just provide a list of API key strings.

    p = pynma.PyNMA(['apikey1','apikey2'])   # multiple API keys
    p = pynma.PyNMA("apikey1","providerkey") # 1 API key with a providerkey

For more flexible usage, you can add and remove keys:

    p.addkey("apikey1")
    p.addkey(["apikey2","apikey3"])

Or set or change the providerkey

    p.developerkey("developerkey")

#### Notification or Push or Add
    
    p.push(application, event, description, (opt) url, (opt) contenttype, (opt) priority, (opt) batch mode, (opt) html)

##### Application

Application is your message generating application name (limited to 256)

ex: my music player

##### Event

Event is the event name (limited to 1000)

ex: switched to next track

##### Description

The description is the payload of your message (limited to 10000 (10k))
ex:

    Playing next song, Blah Blah Blah
    Artist: blah blah
    Album:  blah blah
    Track: 18/24

##### Url

The URL which should be attached to the notification.
This will trigger a redirect when on the user's device launched, and is viewable in the notification list.

##### Content type

Define the content type.
According API, the only content type actually considered is text/html.

##### Priority

Priority goes from -2 (lowest) to 2 (highest). the default priority is 0 (normal)

##### Batch mode

Batch mode is a boolean value to set if you'd like to push the same message to multiple API keys 5 by 5 (as the actual verion of prowl API allows you). This can reduce the number of call you make to the API which are limited.

##### HTML

Set html to True is a shortcut for contenttype="text/html".

#### Return

The push method returns a dict containing different values depending of the success of you call:

##### The call succeed

you'll have in the dict those keys:

    type: success
    code: the HTTP like code (200 if success)
    remaining: the number of API call you can to until the reset
    resetdate: number of remaining minutes till the hourly reset of your API call limit

##### The call failed

For wathever reason, you call failed, the dict key "message" will contains the erro message returned by Prowl API. You'll find those keys:

    code: 400, 401, 402 or 500 (depends of the error kind)
    message: API error message

For the code description,  please refer to [NMA API documentation][NMA API] for more informations

##### The python module encountered an unhandled problem (mostly during parsing)

The return keys will be:

    code: 600
    type: pynmaerror
    message: the exception message
